# Khana-Khazana

"Khana-Khazana" is a Food logger application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM.MVC Desing pattern
was implemented in this application. The Front End uses HTML/CSS/Handlebars with Node and MYSQL in the backend. 

The user can add a new Khana(Indian/Pakistani Food) and either Devour It! or Savor It! If the Khana is Devoured, it is appended
to the Devoured! side of the WebPage. If the Khana is Savored, it is deleted from the database.
